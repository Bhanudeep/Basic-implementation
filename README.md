I have not included any database connections.It is upto you how you implement it, based on your needs.
Authetication keys are not provided. The same can be added once database connection is selected and established.
Otp verification sends Otp to specified email but unless you save that otp in database and compare it with entered otp actual validation will not occur. 
You can change the look and feel easily by navigating to static->styles->.css files .
Make sure you maintain folder structure.
